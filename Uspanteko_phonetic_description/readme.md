# Article details #
These materials are associated with an in-progress manuscript on the phonetics of Uspanteko. The .wav files and Praat TextGrids used for the phonetic description of Uspanteko can be downloaded at https://www.dropbox.com/s/20v9dc5jk18kcl7/Uspanteko_phonetic_description_sounds_TGs.zip?dl=1 (at least until the link rots).

# Disclaimer #
These materials are posted in the spirit of transparency, but also in case they're useful for someone else. I've made very little effort to clean up or otherwise normalize filenames, code, etc.

Any code posted here (in Python, R, Praat, or anything else) is likely to be messy, inefficient, exploratory, and fragile. R code in particular is probably quite patchwork. But I hope it's useful anyway :)
