These materials are posted in the spirit of transparency, but also in case they're useful for someone else. I've made very little effort to clean up or otherwise normalize filenames, code, etc.

Any code posted here (in Python, R, Praat, or anything else) is likely to be messy, inefficient, exploratory, and fragile. R code in particular is probably quite patchwork. But I hope it's useful anyway :)
